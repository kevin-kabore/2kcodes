# Implementation Plan

## Prioritization and Phases

### **Phase 1: Foundational Setup**

1. **Project Initialization**

   - Set up the Next.js project.
   - Configure TypeScript and ESLint for type safety and code quality.
   - Set up environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., database
     credentials, JWT secret).
   - Install and configure **Material UI** and **Emotion** for UI components and
     styling.

2. **Database Setup (PostgreSQL + Prisma)**

   - Initialize the PostgreSQL database on Supabase.
   - Define the initial database schema for `User`, `BlogPost`, `Comment`,
     `NFT`, and `Notification` using **Prisma** as the ORM.
   - Set up Prisma for easy database interaction and migrations.

3. **User Authentication (Dynamic Auth)**
   - Implement the `auth/signup`, `auth/login`, and `auth/logout` endpoints
     using **Dynamic** for user authentication.
   - Implement JWT-based authentication for secure session management.
   - Set up the `auth/user` endpoint to fetch authenticated user details.
   - Test authentication flows with Postman or a similar tool.

### **Phase 2: Core Functionality**

1. **Blog Post Management**

   - Implement `GET /posts`, `GET /posts/{id}`, `POST /posts`,
     `PUT /posts/{id}`, and `DELETE /posts/{id}` endpoints.
   - Integrate Draft.js for the rich-text editor in the frontend.
   - Store and retrieve the blog post content as JSON in the database.
   - Implement client-side rendering of the rich-text content using Draft.js
     utilities.
   - Utilize **Material UI** components for the blog post editor and viewer.

2. **User Interaction (Likes, Comments, Subscriptions)**

   - Implement `POST /posts/{id}/like`, `POST /posts/{id}/comment`, and
     `POST /user/{id}/subscribe` endpoints.
   - Implement comment and like functionality on the frontend.
   - Enable users to subscribe to other users and get notified of new content.

3. **NFT Integration**
   - Implement `POST /posts/{id}/save` to mint NFTs on the Solana blockchain.
   - Set up the Solana integration using Metaplex or Phantom SDKs.
   - Store NFT metadata and wallet information in the database.
   - Display minted NFTs in the user’s gallery.

### **Phase 3: Additional Features and Enhancements**

1. **Notifications**

   - Implement WebSockets for real-time notifications.
   - Set up the `GET /notifications` endpoint.
   - Display notifications in the frontend when a user receives new content
     updates or interactions.

2. **Media Storage**

   - Integrate Cloudinary or Supabase Storage for managing images and other
     media associated with blog posts.
   - Update the blog post creation flow to allow media uploads.

3. **Landing Page**
   - Implement the landing page with introductory information about Kevin
     Kaboré.
   - Use **Material UI** components for the landing page design.
   - Set up navigation to the blog page and other sections.

### **Phase 4: Testing, Optimization, and Deployment**

1. **Testing**

   - Write unit tests for backend endpoints using Jest.
   - Write integration tests for the main features (e.g., user authentication,
     blog post creation).
   - Conduct end-to-end tests for critical user journeys using Cypress.

2. **Performance Optimization**

   - Optimize database queries with Prisma, indexing, and caching (if needed).
   - Implement static site generation (SSG) or server-side rendering (SSR) for
     the blog page.
   - Optimize the loading of rich-text content and media.

3. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the application using Vercel for the frontend and API.
   - Set up continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD)
     pipelines.
   - Monitor application performance and user activity using tools like Google
     Analytics and Sentry.

## Implementation Order

1. **Core Backend Setup (Auth, Database, Blog Post)**
2. **Frontend Integration with Core Features (Auth, Blog Post Editor/Viewer)**
3. **User Interactions (Likes, Comments, Subscriptions)**
4. **NFT Integration and Wallet Management**
5. **Notifications and Real-Time Updates**
6. **Landing Page and Additional Enhancements**
7. **Testing, Optimization, and Deployment**

## Getting Started

1. **Step 1: Initialize Project**

   - Create the Next.js project, configure TypeScript, and set up environment
     variables.
   - Set up **Material UI** and **Emotion** for styling.

2. **Step 2: Set Up User Authentication**

   - Build and test the authentication flow using **Dynamic**.

3. **Step 3: Implement Blog Post CRUD**
   - Integrate Draft.js for rich-text editing and begin building the blog post
     management functionality.
   - Utilize **Prisma** for interacting with the database.

By incorporating Material UI and Emotion for UI components and styling, Prisma
for database interactions, and Dynamic for user authentication, this approach
ensures a smooth and scalable development process that aligns with modern best
practices.
