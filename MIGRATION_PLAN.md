## Technical Decisions & Rationale

### Why These Choices:

1. **NextAuth v5**: Most mature auth solution with Web3 support
2. **tRPC**: End-to-end type safety without GraphQL complexity
3. **Tailwind v4**: Better performance, smaller bundles than MUI
4. **Wagmi + Viem**: Modern Web3 stack, better than ethers.js
5. **Biome**: Faster than ESLint/Prettier combined
6. **Tanstack Query**: Superior caching and state management
7. **Argon2**: More secure than bcrypt for passwords
8. **Pinata**: Reliable IPFS pinning with good free tier

### Architecture Principles:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear service/controller/view layers
- **Type Safety**: Everything typed, no `any`
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JS, better with it
- **Security First**: OWASP compliance, principle of least privilege
- **Performance Budget**: <3s FCP, <100KB JS initial
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum

## Success Metrics:
- Lighthouse score: 90+ across all metrics
- Security: Pass OWASP ZAP scan
- Test coverage: 80%+ 
- Load time: <2s on 3G
- SEO: Perfect technical SEO score

## Notes:
- Each phase builds on the previous
- We'll adjust timelines based on complexity discovered
- Production deployment after Phase 2
- Web3 features can be toggled off initially
